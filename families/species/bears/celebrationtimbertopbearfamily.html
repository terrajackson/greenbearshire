                <h3>Biography Information</h3>

                Father Taylor Timbertop is a great big softy who adores his children, showering them with hugs and
                kisses whenever he gets the chance. He is always ready to change a nappy or help with homework, not that
                he is very good at either.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mother Rose Timbertop loves not only her own children, but all the children in Sylvania, which is why
                her house is always full of noisy youngsters having fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Older Brother Birch Timbertop is a great explorer; he knows every path, trail, cave, hollow tree and
                inch of the Sylvanian woods. He is adding all this knowledge to the collection of maps and diagrams that
                he is busily creating.
                <br>
                <br>
                Older Sister Ivy Timbertop loves sewing and needlepoint. The first shirt she made was for her father; it
                was not one of her better creations! Taylor claims it's his favourite shirt and would never take it off,
                if Rose didn't insist on washing it!
                <br>
                <br>
                Younger Brother Bud Timbertop is very keen on all types of sport. Whether it's swimming, running,
                jumping, rugby or tennis. Bud is always the first in line. He spends every spare moment training for
                this or that sport, all in the hope that one day he'll win a race or game and therefore a silver cup,
                which he would give to his mother.
                <br>
                <br>
                Younger Sister Daisy Timbertop wants to be older so she can cook without her mother's help or sew
                without her sister's help. Maybe, if she were older and taller, her father would stop calling her 'his
                little cherub!'
                <br>
                <br>
                Baby brother Burl Timbertop takes after his oldest brother, Birch, in that if you let him loose in the
                house he goes off exploring. He's been found in every nook and cranny, including inside the broom
                cupboard and under the table. He was even once found inside the grandfather clock!
