                    for her strawberry ice cream cakes and chocolate eclairs. When she isn't baking, she likes cooking
                    delicious maels for the whole family. She has got a weakness for strawberry ice cream and loves to
                    share it with little Beth in winter when it's cold outside an warm inside.

                    <strong>Father Peter Polaris</strong> is one of the best fishermen in town. He loves the sea and has
                    spent a lot of his time studying it. He is always telling his family about his adventures on his
                    boat and stories about faraway lands and oceans. He is easy to spot as he is always wearing his
                    favourite scarf which Julia has knetted to keep him warm on his late night fishing expedtions.

                    bed with her favourite pink blanket that her big sister knitted for her and she treasures the
                    vanilla white scarf her sister Julia knitted for her!
