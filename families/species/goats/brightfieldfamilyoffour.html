                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                <strong>Father Billy Brightfield</strong> and his family moved to Sylvania when Billy got a job there as
                the new village postman. As Sylvania has grown so much over the last few years with more families moving
                into the village, Pete and Sam, the existing postmen, just cannot keep up with all the mail! Billy is
                very conscientious and makes sure everyone's mail is always delivered on time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Nancy Brightfield</strong> loves to sew and make tablecloths and curtains for her family
                home. She is currently making up a large order of gingham cushions for the reading corner at Forest
                Nursery for the pupils to sit on at story time.

                <strong>Sister Mandy Brightfield</strong> likes reading and writing letters to her friends. Seeing them
                at school every day just isn't enough for Mandy, and she is constranly jotting down her thoughts and
                sharing them with her friends. She keeps her father Billy very busy delivering all her letters, but she
                always makes sure she puts a stamp on!
