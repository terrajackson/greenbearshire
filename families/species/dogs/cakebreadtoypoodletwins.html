             <strong>Baby sister Mia Cakebread</strong> smiles at everyone she meets. Even if she's in a place full of people she doesn't know, she plays as comfortably there as she does when she's at home. She can't wait to go to nursery where she can make lots of new friends.

<strong>Baby brother Max Cakebread</strong> is a quiet baby. He's not fussy about his food and he doesn't get into any mischief. But he loves to move around. If his family turn their backs for one moment, he's crawled somewhere far away before they know it. His family are always amazed by how fast he can crawl away.
