                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                  <strong>Father Duke DePembroke</strong> is charming and very debonair, but does have a tendency to put his foot in things. His wife has perfected a stare for when he's about to do it.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Mother Queenie DePembroke</strong> is very much the head of the family, and rules the roost. She is lovely and kind but don't make her cross or you will be treated to the stare.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Brother Earl DePembroke</strong> is as cheeky as he is charming. His mother likes to keep an eye on him so he does not get into trouble.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sister Duchess DePembroke</strong> is a little miss goody two shoes. She's good at everything and is liked by everyone in the village as she's always willing to lend a hand.
