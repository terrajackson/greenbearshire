                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                  <strong>Father Jerry Barker</strong> is the tour guide of Sylvania. He takes visitors to all the points of interest around Sylvania and regales them with information about buildings and their origins, historical events and old customs.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Mother Margo Barker</strong> runs the well organised Tourist Information Office. The walls of Margo's office are full of posters and maps and she has leaflets full of
details about everything that is happening in Sylvania.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Brother Tarquin Barker</strong> does everything at a sedate pace, he never runs or rushes around. If he could, he would spend all day, every day reading a book in front of the warm open fire in the family front room.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sister Jocasta Barker</strong>, unlike her brother is full of energy, rushing hither and thither like a mad thing. Give her a ball and she will play for hours in the garden even if there is no one else to play ball with!
