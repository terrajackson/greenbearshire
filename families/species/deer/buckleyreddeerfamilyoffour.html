                <strong>Father Rupert Buckley</strong> is head of games at Berry Grove School. He is very enthusiastic
                and encourages all the young Sylvanians to do their best in games. Rupert is also very enthusiastic
                about healthy eating, and likes to make salads and soups using ingredients grown in his own vegetable
                garden.

                <strong>Mother Agatha Buckley</strong> is the head teacher at Berry Grove School. Even when she was
                little, Agatha was very academic and always had her homework finished long before her friends. Being
                very kind though, she always helped others once she had finished. But of course, she made sure it was
                all their own work as copying is cheating!

                <strong>Brother Freddie Buckley</strong> loves to paint. His favourite lesson at school is art and he is
                always getting his friends to sit still in the playground or on the school field so he can paint their
                portraits. Freddie is actually getting very good, and spends every lunch time in the art room
                practising. He even sold some paintings at the Village Show this summer.

                <strong>Sister Maria Buckley</strong> is never happier than when in the water. She is a champion swimmer
                and has lots of badges on her swimming costume. Her father, Rupert, coaches her at weekends and after
                school down at the lake and is very proud of his little girl.
