                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Baby Brother Oscar Buckley</strong> can quite often be heard before he is seen! Not because he
                is particularly loud, but because he talks all the time. Since he spoke his first words he has become
                increasingly chatty and his parents find it difficult to get him to go to sleep in the evening as he
                wants to stay up and talk some more!
