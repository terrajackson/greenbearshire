                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Father Hornbull Buttercup</strong> loves walking through the fields and woods around Sylvania
                all alone. He likes the peace and quiet and gets all huffy and bad tempered if he is disturbed during
                his thoughtful strolls. Some children find him frightening!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Daisy Buttercup</strong> is very nosey, and likes to see and know what is going on. If
                she sees anyone out for a walk or off shopping, she will wander over to see what they are up to and have
                a chat!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Paddock Buttercup</strong> is very frisky, running, skipping and jumping everywhere, he
                just canâ€™t seem to stand still for long. All this pent up energy makes Paddock very good at the
                playground game of 'catch' but he is at a disadvantage when the children play a game of 'hide & seek'.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Annabell Buttercup</strong> does not like to rush anything. She walks slowly and
                gracefully, and has never been seen to run or even jog. Getting ready for school in the morning takes
                her hours.
