                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>


                <strong>Father Bertram Bamboo</strong> sits locked up in his study for days and days, surrounded by
                great wobbly piles of old papers. He knows just about everything there is to know about the history of
                Sylvanian Families, their ancestors and how life used to be years and years ago. Indeed, perhaps it's
                better that he stays in his study for so long. He's so terribly clumsy that he's always breaking things
                and if he came out more often there wouldn't be a house left! However, what people like about Bertram
                most is that, whenever he finishes one of his very large books on Sylvania (which isn't often!) he
                always throws a big party to celebrate. Everyone's invited.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Alexandra Bamboo</strong> is an incredible lady. Although she is always arranging fetes,
                parties, barbecues and dances to raise money for local charities, she never seems to get tired. Even
                late at night you can see the light on in her room as she plans her next money raising event. And yet,
                despite her incredible powers of organisation, she's not a busybody - she simply gets things done
                quietly and efficiently. Once when asked how she manages to do all that charity work and cope with her
                amazingly clumsy husband, she replied, "Oh that's easy - I stick all the vases to the tables and hide my
                best crockery!"
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Kane Bamboo</strong> wants to be a writer just like his father - except he wants to
                write children's books rather than history books. Also, just like his father, he is awfully clumsy (he
                must have inherited it!). That means he gets away with never doing the washing up because his mother is
                frightened they won't have anything on which to eat if clumsy Kane is allowed near her crockery. Not
                surprisingly, his friends call him 'Smash' because that's the noise they hear whenever he's around!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong> Sister Clarice Bamboo</strong> has only one thing on her mind. She simply adores horses.
                Indeed, it's rare to hear her talk about anything else. At the moment she's saving up for her very own
                saddle by working at the stables before school, after school, at the weekends and during the holidays.
                She doesn't mind the hard work - in fact, she loves it. "Isn't it wonderful", she says. "I'm getting
                paid to do something I adore!" Eventually she wants to be a top show jumper and win lots of gold medals.
