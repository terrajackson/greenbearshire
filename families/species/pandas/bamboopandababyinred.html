                <strong>Baby Brother Remi Bamboo</strong> is perhaps the only panda in the world who's not always black
                and white. That's because he loves to paint and is often covered in the stuff! Once (about six months
                ago) he painted himself, his bedroom and even his carpet bright pink. He had five weeks without pocket
                money before his parents forgave him! "When I'm a famous artist they'll think differently", he was last
                heard to say as he painted all his little sister's shoes pea green.
