                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Father Rossetti Longfellow Keats</strong>, his delicate puff pastry creations are special
                treats. The Pastry Chef extraordinaire, he fills the kitchen with panache and flair. They say he's a
                poet with flour and yeast, because those chocolate dainties are a feast.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Bronte Keats</strong> runs the Patisserie like clockwork, hard graft she's never known to
                shirk! Efficient she is in every way, she even has time to chat and play. To all her customers she is a
                friend, to all their whims she does attend.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother T S Eliot Keats</strong>, a name no one beats. The longest name of all, a real mouthful
                to call. So Bronte has shortened it a lot, from Tennyson Swift to TS Eliot.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Shelley Keats</strong>, the apple of her father's eye, works with him and makes him sigh.
                Her artistic flair with just plain dough, can turn a cake into a rich Gateau, and a plum- duffing into a
                princely plum pudding.
