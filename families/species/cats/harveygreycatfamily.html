                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>


                <strong>Father Perkin Harvey</strong> runs the Village Store that was started by his now retired mother
                and father many moons ago.
                Perkin thoroughly enjoys his work, meeting and greeting his friendly customers and keeping the store
                clean and tidy with all the shelves well stocked and the fruit and vegetables beautifully presented in
                racks and baskets.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Dorothy Harvey</strong> likes everything in their store neat and tidy just like her
                husband, Perkin. She is also a bit of a tease and has been known to surreptitiously turn some of the
                food cans on the shelves upside down just to see her darling husband get into a bit of a fluster!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Austin Harvey</strong> likes to help his Mother and Father in the store and would love
                to run the store himself one day. He is encouraged by his Grandfather Bert, whom would like the family
                business to stay in the family.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Zara Harvey</strong> is not very keen on working in the family business, she finds the
                whole process of shopkeeping rather tiresome and annoying. So she is working hard at her school work
                with the idea of going to University to get a degree in Social Economics.
