                <h3>From the box:</h3>
                <p>Christian Chantilly is so excited with his new pyjamas, his mother Myriam has a problem getting him
                    to change
                    into his day clothes every morning. The good thing is that now there is no problem getting Christian
                    to bed at
                    night; all you have to do is suggest he tidies up his toys, cleans his teeth, finds something to
                    read and he's off up the stairs.</p>
