                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>


                <bold>Father Septimus Persis</bold>
                is a master craftsman, making the most beautiful, colourful rugs that Sylvania has ever seen! Sitting at
                his loom, surrounded by wonderful, complicated designs, Septimus creates his masterpieces in delicate
                coloured silks and cottons on sturdy jute strands. 'Why have the floor covered in a single coloured
                carpet, when I can give you the moon and stars in a rug?" he asks his customers.
                <br>
                <br>
                <bold>Mother Salome Persis</bold>
                is an artist and draws her inspiration from nature, she creates a lot of the intricate designs that her
                husband Septimus uses in his rugs. Sitting at her easel in the woods drawing and painting for hours,
                Salome feels at peace with the natural world that is all around her.
                <br>
                <br>
                <bold>Brother Nolly Persis'</bold>
                idea of the 'purrfect' day is to play in the garden, only returning to the house at mealtimes. His
                favourite pastime is to climb up all the different trees but predictably, he always seems to gets stuck
                up the biggest tree! As soon as his father, Septimus, hears his son's cries for help, he mutters: "Not
                again!" as he heads out into the garden. Nolly just shrugs his shoulders and smiles each time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <bold>Sister Sadie Persis</bold>
                likes nothing better than to curl up with a good book in the sunniest part of the house. She can spend
                hours reading romantic novels in the sun's warm rays, oblivious to the world around her.
