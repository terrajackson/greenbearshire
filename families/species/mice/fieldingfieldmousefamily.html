                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Father Darcy Fielding</strong> is a cobbler and makes everything from clogs and boots to
                slippers and sandals. He is a very skilled craftsman, but he is also very shy and rarely says more than
                "Thank you, madam," or "Ready next week, sir,"when Sylvanians come into his shop.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Bridget Fielding</strong> is a great help to her husband. She not only buys all the shiny
                materials and colourful laces that he needs to make his fine shoes, but she also assists him with his
                many customers. The only problem with this is that she is very shy too and rarely speaks above a
                whisper. Sometimes she has to repeat herself three or four times before people realise that she's even
                talking to them!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Daniel Fielding</strong> is as intelligent as can be but it took his teachers a long
                time to discover this as he never says more than two words in class. It was only when he got top marks
                in every subject that they realised just how clever he was.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Helen Fielding</strong> is as quiet as the rest of her family, except when it comes to
                netball. She walks out onto the netball court and begins to order everyone around as loudly as possible.
