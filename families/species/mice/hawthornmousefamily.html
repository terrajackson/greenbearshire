                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Father Hickery Hawthorn</strong> is a very happy-go-lucky mouse and is quite content to go with
                the flow and fit in with eveyone else's plans. He wants the quiet life, but his children are noisy and
                his wife, Imogen, nags him morning, noon and night.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Imogen Hawthorn</strong> is one for getting up early and making a start on cleaning the
                house and preparing breakfast. She is always making plans and organising the family's week, with a visit
                here and a trip there.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Bryce Hawthorn</strong> is just like his dad. Quiet, thoughtful and always easy to
                please, he wouldn't say 'boo' to a goose. But put him on a football pitch and he turns into a little
                devil, who's loud and aggressive.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Laurel Hawthorn</strong> is a very busy little girl. In between practising her signature
                and learning 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' on the piano, she insists on helping her mother cook fairy
                cakes and her father with DIY jobs around the house. That's why her bedroom is in such a mess, she has
                no time to keep it tidy!
