                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Father Caspian Neptune</strong> spends as much time as he can with his family swimming in
                    the sea even during those cold, windswept winter days. After a refreshing swim he enjoys a long walk
                    along the beach looking for 'treasure' - strange bits and pieces the sea has washed up on the golden
                    sands. Caspian has quite a large 'treasure' trove displayed around the family home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Mother Narrisa Neptune</strong> likes everything neat and tidy in her family home and her
                    husband and daughter's 'treasure' collection makes for a lot of extra dusting and cleaning! Narrisa
                    has decided this is a small price to pay for all the family time together on the beach.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Sister Shelly Neptune</strong> is a beachcomber like her father. Her love is sea shells of
                    all shapes and sizes. The shell colours are so bright and shiny when they are wet but so dull by the
                    time she has carried them home. So with the help of her father, they varnish the shells to bring out
                    the bright colours, before adding them to her vast shell collection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Baby Sister Sandy Neptune</strong> loves building and knocking down sandcastles and like the
                    rest of her family is also a beach collector, she collects sand! In her clothes, in her hair,
                    between her toes, everywhere!

            <p>The sea otters were sold in the UK, Japan, and USA. This is the Flair (UK) version. The Calico Critters
                version from the United States gave the characters different names and altered their biography.
