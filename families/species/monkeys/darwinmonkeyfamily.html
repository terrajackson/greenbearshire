                <p>

                    <strong>Father Geoff Darwin</strong> knows more about nature than anyone in Sylvania. He is a famous
                    botanist and spends his days in the forest searching for flowers and plants. He is totally devoted
                    to his work and loves nothing better than discovering an interesting new fern or orchid.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Mother Shirley Darwin</strong> carefully draws the plants and flowers her husband brings
                    home each day. Her sketches are so detailed that once it took her over a week to draw a simple
                    buttercup. But thankfully Geoff always thinks his wife's illustrations are worth waiting for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Brother Simion Darwin</strong> is far too energetic to be interested in plants or drawing.
                    His parents think he's too energetic because if he's not playing football he's playing basketball,
                    and if he's not playing basketball he's playing cricket.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Sister Katie Darwin</strong> is almost as active as her brother. As one of the best gymnasts
                    in Sylvania she spends her days swinging on bars, balancing on beams and somersaulting over the
                    floor. Her favourite event is the exercise horse as she loves to show off her strong arms - in fact
                    Simion won't compete with her as he secretly suspects she's stronger than he is!
