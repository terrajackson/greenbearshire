                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                <strong>Alfie</strong> is full of mischief. He watches his father Cedric building things and waits for a
                chance to play tricks. Cedric thinks Alfie is watching because he likes carpentry, and is very happy to
                think that Alfie might follow in his footsteps.

                <strong>Alyssa</strong> likes drawing on the carpentry plans in Cedric's room. Cedric was a little angry
                at Alyssa's mischief at first, but he said "Looks like we have a budding artist!" and gave Alyssa a box
                of crayons all for herself.
