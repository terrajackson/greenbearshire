            <p>I think the Hazelnuts are one of the cutest families of all time! Note their distinctive dark tipped
                tails. </p>

                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                <p><strong> Father Sidney Hazelnut</strong> is a bed maker and a very good one too! His beds are very
                    special
                    because he insists on testing each and every one of them himself. Unfortunately, because they are so
                    comfortable,
                    he keeps falling asleep and just can't keep up with customer demand. Beteween the yawns he will tell
                    you that your
                    bed will be ready in a week or three!</p>
                <br/>
                <p><strong>Mother Mona Hazelnut</strong> complements her husband's work perfectly by making bed linen,
                    quilts, pillows, and bed
                    covers. Mona's new designs are beautifully colour co-ordinated, with great attention paid to detail
                    in the trim and finish, but most
                    importantly they keep you warm, snug and cozy in bed!</p>
                <br/>
                <p><strong>Brother Otto Hazelnut</strong>, like his father, loves his bed. His mother has to call him at
                    least three times every morning to get up
                    for school. However, Saturday morning is different. This is the day Otto plays football and gets
                    himself up, dressed, and grabs a quick
                    breakfast before setting off to play without one prompt from his mother.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><strong>Sister Odette Hazelnut</strong> is a very quiet, softly spoken young lady. All her school
                    friends make a point to look after her, making
                    sure she is alright! Whether in the classroom or on the school bus, they take it in turns to check
                    that she has not fallen asleep.</p>
