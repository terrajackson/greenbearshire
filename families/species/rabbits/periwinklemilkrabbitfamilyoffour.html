                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                Father <strong>Alex Periwinkle</strong>, the Sylvanian signwriter, has to be incredibly patient when he
                is working, because one mistake and he has to start all over again. His biggest job to date was
                preparing the signs and banners for the House of Brambles Department Store.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mother <strong>Kate Periwinkle</strong> helps her husband, Alex, with the design and use of colour in
                his work as well as looking after the family. She gets very annoyed with Alex because he is always
                forgetting to change into his old work clothes for work and comes home with different coloured paw
                prints all over his trousers. This causes lots and lots of washing and ironing which Kate has little
                time for, being a very busy lady!
                <br>
                <br>
                Brother <strong>Oliver Periwinkle</strong> is very good at tennis. When his grandfather, Mack, told him
                that one day he might become the Sylvanian Open Tennis Champion, he thought that he was joking and said:
                "You cannot be serious".
                <br>
                <br>
                Sister <strong>Rebecca Periwinkle</strong> is an all-round athlete, playing rounders and hockey for the
                school and tennis with her brother, whom she just loves to beat. She is always hopping from one game to
                another.
