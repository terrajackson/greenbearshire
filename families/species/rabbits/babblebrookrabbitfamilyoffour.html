            <p>The Babblebrooks are one of the original Sylvanian Families. This particular version is from<br> the US,
                when the name for the American line was still Sylvanian Families (rather than the current name, Calico
                Critters.)
                I'm especially fond of all the original families.</p>

                <h3>Biography Information</h3>

                Rocky Babblebrook runs the General Store. If he doesn't sell it, you probably don't need it.

                <br>
                Crystal Babblebrook is the best cook in our whole woods. She even wrote a cookbook once!

                Bubba Babblebrook is all ears. He can hear a bee buzz a block away. He says he hears grass grow.
                <br>

                Breezy Babblebrook likes to have her own way. Luckily, her way is a nice way.
