                No one knows how <strong>Lavender and Larkspur</strong> came to the Sylvanian Woods.
                One day, when Tamsie Honey-Bear was out looking for berries, she saw an unusual pile
                of leaves. When she looked under it, there were lavender and Larkspur, cosily curled up,
                sound asleep. Tamsie took them straight home and, after bathing them, feeding them and
                snuggling them up in up bed, she went out and asked every Sylvanian she could find
                if the knew anything about the twins. No one did. It's all so mysterious that Tamsie
                secretly that Lavender and Larkspur may have been left by good fairies. Could you find
                a home for Lavender and Larkspur in your Sylvanian Collection?
