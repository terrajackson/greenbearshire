                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                <strong>Father Aaron Cottontail</strong> is a down-to-earth and hardworking furniture maker, who takes
                great pride in his family and his work. He is such a skilled craftsman, everybody in Sylvania can
                recognise his furniture, because each piece looks just like a work of art.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Sorrel Cottontail</strong> is a practical mother and homemaker, who spends all her spare
                time - which is not much! - decorating and improving the family's beautiful home. A great D.I.Y. expert
                is Sorrel!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Gromwell Cottontail</strong> is a very energetic boy who loves football and cricket. He
                has the untidiest bedroom in Sylvania, which he is always telling his mother he will tidy tomorrow. But
                tomorrow never seems to come!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Willow Cottontail</strong> is always up to something. Her father says she should have
                been called Wild not Willow! Whether up a tree or down a hole, sheâ€™s always in trouble. But all it takes
                is a winning smile and a peck on his cheek, to get her back into his good books.
