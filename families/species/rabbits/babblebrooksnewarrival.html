                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                George Babblebrook and his darling wife Harriet have a new arrival; a beautiful bouncing baby girl
                called Freddie. George, the proud father, couldn't wait to take his little
                bundle of joy to the seaside to play in the golden sands by the shore. George's fondest childhood
                memories are all of his visits to the beach as a youngseter with his father. Freddie loves to help her
                dad build sandcastles but knocking them down with a squeal of joy is so much more fun!
