                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>

                <strong>Father Frasier Chocolate</strong> has been making sweets since he was a young boy and he's now a
                confectioner of the highest calibre. It all started when his mother showed him how to make crystallised
                fruit, which is very easy, but his chocolate creations today are a work of art as well as tasting
                heavenly.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Teri Chocolate</strong> makes all the fillings for Frasier's chocolate creations; the
                strawberry surprise being the best. Her kitchen is always full of the rich smell of fruit mixed with the
                sweet smells of sugar and spices bubbling in pots. It makes your mouth water just thinking about it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Brother Coco Chocolate</strong> is not permitted to help his father or mother in the preparation
                of their confections concoctions because he eats more than he makes! He's put to useful employment being
                delivery boy for the family.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Freya Chocolate</strong>, unlike her brother, doesn't eat sweets or chocolate, so she
                helps her mother prepare the fillings. She does eat a lot of fruit thought!
