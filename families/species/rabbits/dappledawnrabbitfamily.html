                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>


                <strong>Father Herbage Dappledawn</strong> is the instigator in the family for going on long walks in
                what he calls 'The Great Outdoors'. In fact, his family call him 'Big Foot' because he takes such big
                strides that the children almost have to run in order to keep up with him! Country walks turn into
                Country Runs whenever you go out with Herbage. When he is at home, he can't keep still and goes and
                organises the sports activity classes for all the Sylvanian children.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mother Theodora Dappledawn</strong> has a passion for anything old. Herbage always jokes with
                her that's why she married him! Family life apart, her favourite past time is visiting stately homes and
                historic monuments. She spends a lot of time visiting Bertram Bamboo and his Sylvanian museum and reads
                lots of history books in Bob Catwood's Library. Theodora likes to trace family trees and always gets
                very excited if she finds a Sylvanian who is a distant relation to royalty! She enjoys taking the
                children on local history trips from school, showing them all the ancient monuments in Sylvania.
                Theodora makes up brilliant stories about Sylvanian ancestors and all the children really think she
                brings 'history to life'.

                <br>
                <strong>Brother Radish Dappledawn</strong> always runs everywhere. He enjoys history too but the sort of
                sword fights and battles. He can often be seen pretending to be a gallant knight rescuing fair maidens
                and challenging other knights to duels. His favourite pastime is orienteering and has already encouraged
                Scott Corntop, Bubba Babblebrook and Rusty Wildwood amongst others to join him running in the woods
                looking for secret spots with the aid of a map and compass.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sister Tlly Dappledawn</strong> is just the opposite of her brother. She is very quiet and
                happily spends hours and hours painting and creating wonderful pictures of the Sylvanian countryside.
                While her brother is running about in the woods, Tilly enjoys sitting at her easel and painting to her
                heart's content. During the winter, Tilly loves to knit by the fireside. Everyone in her family is
                always well clad with jumpers and scarves to keep the cold out.
