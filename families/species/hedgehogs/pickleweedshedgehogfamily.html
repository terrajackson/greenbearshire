                <h3>Calico Critters Biography Information</h3>

                the lyrics of all the songs they perform at local fairs and shows. Her voice is so beautiful
                that when she sings, everyone stops talking just to hear her! Heloise enjoys cooking with ingredients
                from the forest. She is famous for her mushroom pie!

                friends and family. He also plays the drums in the family's band and he loves creating new beats and
                sounds.
                He would play the drums all night if Mother Heloise wouldn't remind him to go to bed!
