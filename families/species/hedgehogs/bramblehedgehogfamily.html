                <h3>UK Biography Information</h3>
                Father Mortimer Bramble is the Sylvanian tailor. He makes all the clothes for everyone in Sylvania. He
                loves sewing while gently rocking in his rocking chair.

                <br>
                Mother Eleanor Bramble designs and makes all the special Sylvanian costumes like wedding outfits and
                Sunday best clothes.

                Brother Maxwell Bramble is learning how to be a tailor like his dad. He's particularly good at measuring
                up material, but he can't play with the needles and scissors as these can be dangerous.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sister Abigail Bramble likes designing clothes. She's especially good at designing dresses and frocks
                for herself which, if she is good, Mortimer and Eleanor make for her.
