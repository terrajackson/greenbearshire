            <p>This set includes Constance Cheshire and Carlotta Bassett.</p>
            <p>From the box:<br></p>
            <p> Constance and Carlotta can't wait for Monday evening to come around, because that is<br> when they have
                their weekly music lesson, which they just love. The two girls are taking lessons<br> in singing and
                playing the violin but, as they only have one violin, they have to take it in turns to play it while the
                other sings along! They take their music very seriously and always dress up for their lesson in their
                favourite dresses and best shoes. </p>
