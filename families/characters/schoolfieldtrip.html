            <p>A Bearbury Bear sister, Hazelwood Mouse brother and sister, and two Fisher Cat babies are on
                an adventure with their teacher, Mrs. Fisher Cat.</p>
            <p>From the box:<br>
                Mrs Fisher, the new schoolteacher, is famous throughout Sylvania for her love of field trips,<br> where
                the children get lots of fresh air! Many an afternoon you will see a line of smart, young<br> pupils
                marching along under her watchful eye, off to explore the banks of the pond or the undergrowth in the
                woods. The children have been on so many trips that their project books are almost fit to burst with the
                different leaves and assorted flora they have found. </p>
